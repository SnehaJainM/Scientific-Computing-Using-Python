# List Comprehension is a way to construct a new Python list from an iterable types: lists, tuples, and strings. All without using a for loop or the `.append()` list method.

# In this project, you'll write a program that takes a string formatted in Camel Case or Pascal Case, then converts it into Snake Case.

# The project has two phases: first you'll use a for loop to implement the program. Then you'll learn how to use List Comprehension instead of a loop to achieve the same results.

'''
Step 1'''
# In this project, you are going to build a program that takes a camelCase or PascalCase formatted string as input and converts that to a snake_case formatted string using two approaches. First, you'll use a for loop and then list comprehension to achieve the same results. You'll see how list comprehension can make your code more concise.

# Start defining a new function named convert_to_snake_case() that accepts a string named pascal_or_camel_cased_string as input. For now, add a pass statement inside the function.

def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    pass

'''# Step 2'''
# You need to add an empty list that will hold the characters of the string after you have converted them to snake case.

# Inside the function, replace the pass statement by creating an empty list named snake_cased_char_list.

def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    snake_cased_char_list = []
    
'''    
Step 3'''
# With the empty list in place, now you can start iterating through the input string and convert it into snake case.

# Inside the function, below the list you just created, add a for loop to iterate through the pascal_or_camel_cased_string. Make sure to name the target variable char. For now, add a pass statement as a placeholder in the loop body.
def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    snake_cased_char_list = []
    for char in pascal_or_camel_cased_string:
        pass
        
        
'''# Step 4'''
# In both camel case and pascal case, uppercase characters mark the beginning of new words. To convert the input string to snake case, you will need to check if the characters in the input string are uppercase.

# You can use the .isupper() string method to check if a character is uppercase. This method returns True if the character is uppercase and False if it is not.

# Inside the for loop, add an if statement to check if the current character is uppercase. Move the pass statement inside the new if statement.

def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    snake_cased_char_list = []
    for char in pascal_or_camel_cased_string:
        if char.isupper():
            pass
        
'''# Step 5'''
# Inside the if statement body, you need to convert any uppercase character to lowercase and prepend an underscore to this lowercase character.

# Use the .lower() string method to convert uppercase characters to lowercase characters. Then, prepend an underscore to the character. Assign the results to a variable named converted_character.

    snake_cased_char_list = []
    for char in pascal_or_camel_cased_string:

        if char.isupper():
            converted_character='_'+char.lower()
            
'''Step 6'''
# Within the if statement body, you are going to add the converted character to the list you created earlier.

# For this, the .append() method will be used. This method adds a given object to the end of the list it is invoked on.

# Use the .append() method on the snake_cased_char_list to add the converted_character to the list.


def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    snake_cased_char_list = []
    for char in pascal_or_camel_cased_string:
        
        if char.isupper():
            converted_character = '_' + char.lower()
            snake_cased_char_list.append(converted_character)
            
            
'''Step 7'''
# You need to handle the characters that are already in lowercase by adding them to the list of converted characters.

# Right after the if statement within the for loop, add an else clause and use the .append() method to add char to the snake_cased_char_list variable.

def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    snake_cased_char_list = []
    for char in pascal_or_camel_cased_string:
        
        
        if char.isupper():
            converted_character = '_' + char.lower()
            snake_cased_char_list.append(converted_character)
        else:
            snake_cased_char_list.append(char)
            
            
'''Step 8'''
# By this point, the variable snake_cased_char_list holds the list of converted characters. To combine these characters into a single string, you can utilize the .join() method.

# The join method works by concatenating each element of a list into a string, separated by a designated string, known as the separator.

# Example Code
# result_string = ''.join(characters)
# The example above joins together the elements of the characters list into a single string where each element is concatenated together using an empty string as the separator.

# Now, right after the for loop, use the .join() method to join the elements in snake_cased_char_list using an empty string as the separator. Assign the result to a new variable named
def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):

        if char.isupper():
            converted_character = '_' + char.lower()
            snake_cased_char_list.append(converted_character)
        else:
            snake_cased_char_list.append(char)
    snake_cased_string = ''.join(snake_cased_char_list)
    
    
# Step 9
# In pascal case, strings begin with a capital letter. After converting all the characters to lowercase and adding an underscore to them, there's a chance of having an extra underscore at the start of your string.

# The easiest way to fix this is by using the .strip() string method, which removes from a string any leading or trailing characters among a set of characters passed as its argument. For example:

# Example Code
# original_string = "_example_string_"

# clean_string = original_string.strip('_')
# The strip() method is applied to original_string. This removes any leading and trailing underscore. The result of the example above would be the string 'example_string'.

# Declare a new variable named clean_snake_cased_string and assign it the result of the .strip() method applied to snake_cased_string , passing '_' as the argument to the method.
    snake_cased_string = ''.join(snake_cased_char_list)
    clean_snake_cased_string = snake_cased_string.strip('_')
    
    
# Step 10
# To wrap up the function, return the clean_snake_cased_string. This will complete the function and allow you to use it to convert strings from pascal or camel case to snake case.

# Add a return statement at the end of the function to return the clean_snake_cased_string.
    return clean_snake_cased_string


'''Step 11'''
# With the function complete, you can now use it inside another function.

# Create a new function called main() with pass as the body of the function.

def main():
    pass


'''# Step 12'''
# Inside the main() function, replace the pass statement, with a call to the convert_to_snake_case() function, passing the string 'aLongAndComplexString' as input.

# To display the output, pass the function call as the argument to the print() function.

def main():
    print(convert_to_snake_case('aLongAndComplexString'))
    
'''Step 13'''
# In order to display the output of the convert_to_snake_case() function, you need to call the main() function.

# At the same level as the two existing functions, add a call to the main() function. You should see the given camel or pascal cased string converted to snake case upon execution.

main()


'''Step 14'''

# So far, in this project you have used a for loop to iterate over your input string and convert it into the desired output. Now you'll begin the transition from a for loop to a list comprehension.

# Begin by commenting out all the lines of code inside the convert_to_snake_case() function. Don't delete them as they'll be helpful when you implement the logic using a list comprehension.

# Remember to add the pass keyword to the function body to prevent the code from failing during the tests.

# Example Code
# words_list = ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'chained', 'methods']

# Step 19
# In Python, a list comprehension is a construct that allows you to generate a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable and optionally filtering items with a condition. Apart from being briefer, list comprehensions often run faster.

# A basic list comprehension consists of an expression followed by a for clause:

# Example Code
# spam = [i * 2 for i in iterable]
# The above uses the variable i to iterate over iterable. Each elements of the resulting list is obtained by evaluating the expression i * 2 at the current iteration.

# In this step, you need to fill the empty list snake_cased_char_list using the list comprehension syntax.

# Turn your empty list into a list comprehension that converts each character in pascal_or_camel_cased_string into a lowercase character and prepends an underscore to it (the code you commented out before may help you write the expression). Use char to iterate over pascal_or_camel_cased_string.
def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    snake_cased_char_list = ['_'+char.lower() for char in pascal_or_camel_cased_string ]
    return ''.join(snake_cased_char_list).strip('_')



# Step 20
# List comprehensions accept conditional statements, to evaluate the provided expression only if certain conditions are met:

# Example Code
# spam = [i * 2 for i in iterable if i > 0]
# As you can see from the output, the list of characters generated from pascal_or_camel_cased_string has been joined. Since the expression inside the list comprehension is evaluated for each character, the result is a lowercase string with all the characters separated by an underscore.

# Follow the example above to add an if clause to your list comprehension so that the expression is executed only if the character is uppercase.


    #'''List Comprehensions are always written ultaaa '''

    snake_cased_char_list = ['_' + char.lower()  for char in pascal_or_camel_cased_string if char.isupper()]


# Step 21
# Still, the final result is not exactly what you want to achieve. You need to execute a different expression for the characters filtered out by the if clause. You'll use an else clause for that:

# Example Code
# spam = [i * 2 if i > 0 else -1 for i in iterable]
# Note that, differently from the if clause, the if/else construct must be placed between the expression and the for keyword.

# Modify your list comprehension so that when a character is not uppercase it remains unchanged.

    snake_cased_char_list = ['_' + char.lower() if char.isupper() else char  for char in pascal_or_camel_cased_string ]
    
    
# Step 22
# Get rid of the commented lines of code inside the convert_to_snake_case() function to clean up the function definition.

'''# Step 23'''
# Finally try out this new implementation by executing the program. Change the input string to 'IAmAPascalCasedString' and see if it comes out as 'i_am_a_pascal_cased_string', even though that's a lie.

# If you've done everything correctly, you should see the input string converted into snake case, like before.

# Congratulations! Now your convert_to_snake_case() function is ready.
