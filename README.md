# Cipher Project 🤖🐍

## Overview

In this project, I explored fundamental programming concepts in Python 🐍, focusing on encryption techniques. I learned how to implement both the Caesar cipher and the Vigenère cipher, which are classic methods for encoding messages🔐.

## Key Learnings

- **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: An advanced encryption technique that uses a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext, creating a more secure message than the Caesar cipher.

## Project Goals

- Understand basic encryption methods.
- Apply Python programming concepts like variables, functions, and loops to solve real-world problems. 🙂
