## 1. Cipher Project 🔑🐍

### Overview

In this project, I explored fundamental programming concepts in Python 🐍, focusing on encryption techniques. I learned how to implement both the Caesar cipher and the Vigenère cipher, which are classic methods for encoding messages🔐.

### Key Learnings ✉️

- **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: An advanced encryption technique that uses a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext, creating a more secure message than the Caesar cipher.

### Project Goals

- Understand basic encryption methods.
- Apply Python programming concepts like variables, functions, and loops to solve real-world problems. 🙂

- **Enhance Security Practices**: Understand and apply best practices for generating secure passwords in Python.

## 6. Shortest Path Algorithm Project 🗺️🛣️

### Overview

In this project, I implemented a shortest path algorithm to find the shortest distance between nodes in a graph. The algorithm uses Dijkstra’s method to compute the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph represented by a dictionary. This implementation also allows for querying the shortest path to a specific target node and outputs both the shortest distance and the path taken.

### Key Learnings 🚥

- **Shortest Path Algorithm**: Applying Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
