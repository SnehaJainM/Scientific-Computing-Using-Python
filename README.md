# Scientific Computing with Python by FreeCodeCamp üë®üèª‚Äçüíª 

## 1. Cipher Project üîëüêç

### Overview

In this project, I explored fundamental programming concepts in Python üêç, focusing on encryption techniques. I learned how to implement both the Caesar cipher and the Vigen√®re cipher, which are classic methods for encoding messagesüîê.

### Key Learnings

- **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
- **Vigen√®re Cipher**: An advanced encryption technique that uses a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext, creating a more secure message than the Caesar cipher.

### Project Goals

- Understand basic encryption methods.
- Apply Python programming concepts like variables, functions, and loops to solve real-world problems. üôÇ

## 2. Luhn Algorithm üî¢

### Overview

The Luhn Algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate various identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. This algorithm helps in detecting errors in digits by performing a series of operations to ensure the number is valid according to a particular set of rules.

### Key Learnings

- **Checksum Calculation**: The algorithm uses a series of operations to generate a checksum, which is then used to verify the validity of the number.
- **Digit Manipulation**: Understanding how to manipulate and validate numerical data in Python through algorithms.
- **Error Detection**: Learning how to identify common errors in numerical sequences and ensure data integrity.

### Project Goals

- Implement the Luhn Algorithm to validate credit card numbers and other identification numbers.
- Develop an understanding of how checksum algorithms work and their application in data validation.
- Enhance skills in Python programming related to numerical operations and validation techniques.

## 3. List Comprehension Project üìù

### Overview

This project explores list comprehension in Python, which provides a concise way to construct lists from iterable types like lists, tuples, and strings. The task involves converting strings from Camel Case or Pascal Case to Snake Case using list comprehension.

### Key Learnings

- **List Comprehension**: A compact way to generate lists by applying an expression to each item in an iterable, eliminating the need for explicit loops or the `.append()` method.
- **String Manipulation**: Transforming string formats efficiently using Python's powerful list comprehension features.

### Project Goals

- **Understand List Comprehension**: Learn how to use list comprehension for more concise and readable code.
- **String Conversion**: Develop a program to convert Camel Case or Pascal Case strings to Snake Case.
- **Apply Python Techniques**: Use list comprehension to simplify and enhance code functionality.

## 4. Numerical Methods Project üîç

### Overview

This project focuses on numerical methods, specifically the bisection method, used to approximate solutions to mathematical problems. The goal is to find the square root of a number by iteratively narrowing down the possible range of values.

### Key Learnings

- **Bisection Method**: A technique for approximating the square root of a number by iteratively dividing the range of possible values.
- **Numerical Approximation**: Understanding how numerical methods can be used to solve mathematical problems that are difficult to tackle analytically.

### Project Goals

- **Implement the Bisection Method**: Develop a program to approximate square roots using this iterative numerical method.
- **Explore Numerical Approximation**: Learn how numerical methods can provide practical solutions to complex problems.
- **Enhance Python Skills**: Apply numerical methods to improve problem-solving abilities in Python.
