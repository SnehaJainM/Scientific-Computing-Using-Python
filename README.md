# Scientific Computing with Python by FreeCodeCamp 👨🏻‍💻 

## 1. Cipher Project 🤖🐍

### Overview

In this project, I explored fundamental programming concepts in Python 🐍, focusing on encryption techniques. I learned how to implement both the Caesar cipher and the Vigenère cipher, which are classic methods for encoding messages🔐.

### Key Learnings

- **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: An advanced encryption technique that uses a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext, creating a more secure message than the Caesar cipher.

### Project Goals

- Understand basic encryption methods.
- Apply Python programming concepts like variables, functions, and loops to solve real-world problems. 🙂

## 2. Luhn Algorithm 🔢

### Overview

The Luhn Algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate various identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. This algorithm helps in detecting errors in digits by performing a series of operations to ensure the number is valid according to a particular set of rules.

### Key Learnings

- **Checksum Calculation**: The algorithm uses a series of operations to generate a checksum, which is then used to verify the validity of the number.
- **Digit Manipulation**: Understanding how to manipulate and validate numerical data in Python through algorithms.
- **Error Detection**: Learning how to identify common errors in numerical sequences and ensure data integrity.

### Project Goals

- Implement the Luhn Algorithm to validate credit card numbers and other identification numbers.
- Develop an understanding of how checksum algorithms work and their application in data validation.
- Enhance skills in Python programming related to numerical operations and validation techniques. 

#### Thanks! 😇
